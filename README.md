Exergy
======

This is a pet project whose primary purpose is to help me learn Go.

Exergy is a BASIC interpreter that can be used through a browser. At this very early stage, only two commands are implemented

* print - prints out the expression that follows
* clear - clears the window
* let - sets a variable, which can then later be used in expressions. No spaces allowed between the variable, =, and the value/expression

No variables exist, and the only thing that can be printed out is that floating point result of an expression that uses +, -, *, / and parentheses.

Just download the code and 'go run' it. Then point your browser at localhost:8080 and have a play.
