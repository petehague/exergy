Exergy
======

Exergy is a BASIC intepreter that can be used through a browser. At this very early stage, only two commands are implemented

* print - prints out the expression that follows
* clear - clears the window

No variables exist, and the only thing that can be printed out is that floating point result of an expression that uses +, -, *, / and parentheses.
